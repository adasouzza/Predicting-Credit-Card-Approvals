# Predicting Credit Card Approvals

## Project Description
Commercial banks receive numerous credit card applications, many of which are rejected for reasons such as high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming. Fortunately, this task can be automated using machine learning. In this project, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, similar to the approaches used by real banks.

The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Project Tasks
1. **Credit card applications**
2. **Inspecting the applications**
3. **Splitting the dataset into train and test sets**
4. **Handling the missing values (part i)**
5. **Handling the missing values (part ii)**
6. **Handling the missing values (part iii)**
7. **Preprocessing the data (part i)**
8. **Preprocessing the data (part ii)**
9. **Fitting a logistic regression model to the train set**
10. **Making predictions and evaluating performance**
11. **Grid searching and making the model perform better**
12. **Finding the best-performing model**

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found in the [Credit Card Approval dataset](URL_TO_DATASET) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
